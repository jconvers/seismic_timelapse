# seismic_timelapse

small project to create a time-lapse for EQs in Brazil

credits: https://github.com/meyavuz for general code structure


General modifications: 
colors (historical/instrumental), modified manually (check the script)
magnitude scaling/legends (pending)
scripts to run for all the years to create the snapshots

catalog data used here was downloaded from
 http://moho.iag.usp.br/rq/event
and then converted to csv


still not implemented: an automated method for the timelapse movie
(i.e. you have to make the movie yourself)
